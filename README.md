# Modding your Joying/FYT SC9853i unit without root
### Only for real Joying SC9853i units. Other FYT compatibles are not supported.

### Support via the XDA forum thread ["Modding your Joying/FYT SC9853i unit without root"](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android-auto/android-head-units/modding-joying-fyt-sc9853i-unit-root-t3974357)


The zips that can be found in these sub-folders can be directly unzipped to a clean, empty Fat32 formatted USB-stick or SD-card.

When this USB-stick or SD-card is inserted into your unit, the unit will recognize it as a flashable firmware.

Notes:
* These flashable firmware files will leave all your installed apps and settings as they are. Only the files in these Allapp.pkg files will be overwritten.
* The zips containing boot images will only overwrite the boot image. All apps and settings remain as they are.
* The "combi" zips are just combinations of possible mods and/or boot images. They behave the same as the previous two.
