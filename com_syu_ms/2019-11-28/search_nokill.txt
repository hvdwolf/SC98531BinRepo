jadx-gui 0.9 and up support "Deobfuscation", but that doesn't always work.
Lines/example below are for standard mode without Deobfuscation.

Search for:   runningAppProcesses = n.getRunningAppProcesses();

This will be in some method like:  public static void o() {

This method is called by another method like:
    public static void n() {
        o();
    }

Find the line number for "o();" and disable that line.
In this version smali/app/ac.smali ".line 553"
