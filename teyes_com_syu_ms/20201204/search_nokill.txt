jadx-gui 0.9 and up support "Deobfuscation", but that doesn't always work.
Lines/example below are for standard mode WITHOUT Deobfuscation.

Search for:   runningAppProcesses = n.getRunningAppProcesses();

This will be in some method like:  public static void o() {

This method is called by another method like:
    public static void n() {
        o();
    }

In this version in jadx-gui, you will find it in app.ad in line 555.
Now go into the smali code.
Find the line number for "o();" and disable that line.
e.g.
    .line 555
    invoke-static {}, Lapp/ac;->o()V

In this version smali/app/ad.smali ".line 555"
